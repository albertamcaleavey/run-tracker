# Run Tracker
Run Tracker is a app for tracking your runs and related fitness goals. Users can log details about their runs, create new goals for and mark them off as they've been achieved. 

## Motivation  
As a long time runner, I created Run Tracker to visualize my progress and keep track of my run related goals. Taking inspiration from running apps I've used in the past, I designed Run Tracker to be a individualized space for users, emphasizing the importance of comparing your progress only to your past self.
